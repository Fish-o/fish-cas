# A Fishy Computer Algebra System

Ever used a calculator? They kinda suck right?
You do 2+3*5 and it spits out 25, you give it an equation like 3x=5 and it doesn't even know how to start!
That's why i'm making this.
Also, i was bored.

Anyways, we'll se how much it can do by the end! It's a fun project and I'll learn something from it for sure.
