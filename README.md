# A Fishy Computer Algebra System

Ever used a calculator? They kinda suck right?
You do 2+3*5 and it spits out 25, you give it an equation like 3x=5 and it doesn't even know how to start!
That's why i'm making this.
Also, i was bored.

Anyways, we'll see how much it can do by the end! It's a fun project and I'll learn something from it for sure.

### TODO:

- âœ… Tokenizing negatives and decimals
- âœ… Add implicit multiplication in scenarios like 5a or 2(a+b)
- âœ… Create custom functions
- âœ… Add booleans
- âœ… Add comparators
- âœ… Add cases for functions
- Have exact roots: sqrt(50) = 5sqrt(2)
- Allow for multiple answers to single expression (e.g. x^2=4 => x=2 v x =-2)
- Logarithms
- âœ… Implement some algebra to turn y=2x into x=y/2
- ðŸš§ Add algebra that expands
- ðŸš§ Add algebra that simplifies
- Graphing
- Combinatorics
- Logical
